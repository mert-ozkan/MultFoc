In the next screen you will see a fixation target.
Keep your eyes on the fixation target throughout the experiment.

Before each trial, make sure you are directly looking at the fixation target.
First, you will be introduced to an array of discs.
Next, UP TO THREE discs will briefly turn RED.
This is your CUE for which discs to attend to.
You have to ATTEND the cued discs while keeping your eyes at the fixation target.
Several BLACK ARCS will appear on the LEFT or RIGHT side of two discs at random intervals.
We ask you to count certain configurations of the arcs as listed below:

If only ONE disc was cued:    
!! COUNT how many times an arc appeared on the LEFT side of the disc !!


If TWO discs were cued:
!! COUNT how many times the CUED DISCS had an ARC that points at the SAME SIDE (left or right)!!
!! DO NOT COUNT if the arc appeared on the UNCUED DISC!!


If THREE discs were cued:
!! COUNT how many times the CUED DISCS had an ARC that points at the SAME SIDE (left or right)!!

You will report the number by pressing the number key in the response screen at the end of each trial.

C = 0   V=1   B=2   N=3
